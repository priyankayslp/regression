read the data using pandas
plot the scatter plot to visualise the relation between ENGINESIZE AND CO2EMISSIONS
split train data using numpy:80%
split test dat : 20%
fit the data into linear regression model using scikit learn
find the coefficient and intercept 
and plot the fit line over the data 
calculate the errors like mean absolute and mean square
and also calculate R2_Score which is a measure of how close the data are to the fitted regression line.Higher the value good is the model
caluculate the adjusted r2 when more than one independent variable is there
